This collection of Jupyter notebooks contains a basic introduction to finite difference methods for steady and transient transport phenomena in one and two dimensions. The notebooks were created by the [Schiller Research Group](https://cecas.clemson.edu/copmat/) to accompany the undergraduate course _Transport Phenomena (MSE 3270)_ in the curriculum for [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/mse/) at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/). The notebooks have been developed for the [nanoHUB](https://nanohub.org/) platform.
